# JWLI Mock
This is an old landing page for the Japanese Women's Leadership Initiative group. I recreated this page as a test for myself, and to get some more practice with media queries in CSS.

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML and CSS

## Lessons Learned:
I was able to get great practice with using media queries for this site in order to make sure it was responsive. I was still getting myself used to working with media queries, so this site was helpful with getting some more practice.
